# Reading-List-hard
Users should be able to add a book to their reading list by providing a book title, an author's name, a year of publication, and whether or not the book has been read.
The program should store information about all of these books in a file called books.csv, and this data should be stored in CSV format. 
Users should be able to retrieve the books in their reading list, and these books should be printed out in a user-friendly format. 
Users should be able to search for a specific book by providing a book title. 
Users should be able to mark a book as read by entering a book title. 
If there are multiple books with the same title, you can just mark the first matching book as read. 
Users should be able to delete books from their reading list by providing the book title for the book they want to delete. 
Once again, you can just delete the first matching book. 
Users should be able to select these options from a text menu, and they should be able to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
